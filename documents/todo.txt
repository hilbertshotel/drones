Find

1. init process has fault when running search from the terminal
2. memory and CPU in analitics
3. synchronize analitics to stdout + add more listeners and test if it will run faster
3. automate the test by distributing the drone.decoy files and after finding them stopping the VM and deleting them

PROBLEMS:
1. can't use server out of the erlang shell properly

installation guide:
- install erlang (you need BEAM)
- pull binary folder on pc
- add binary folder to PATH
    *find.exe (Haskell binary that executes the beam file)
    *find.beam (actual search engine)
- use: find <pattern> <optional drive>
    (under the hood the binary calls erl -noshell -run find main <pattern> <drive default=c:/>)

info:
- searches only filenames
- shallow searches are much faster than windows search
- takes a long time (around 2minutes for 50GB) to end a full search but usually it's not necessary
